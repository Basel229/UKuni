		<p style="font-size: 17px;">The University of South Florida (USF) is offering some generous scholarships for top students who are either freshmen or transfer! To be considered for merit-based scholarships from the Office of Admissions, students must submit a completed admissions application by the priority deadline.</p>
		
		<center><span style="color: red">Application Submission Deadline: February 15</span></center>
		<center><span style="color: red">Application Completion Deadline: May 1</span></center>

		<p style="font-size: 17px;">Below are the documents that are needed to be sent to the University by the scholarship completion deadline of May 1st:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Official SAT/ACT scores.</li>
			<li>Official Post-Secondary transcripts</li>
			<li>For Upper Level Transfer students (determined by USF during evaluation), they will need to provide official TOEFL or IELTS.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>SCHOLARSHIPS ARE ONLY AVAILABLE FOR STUDENTS STARTING IN THE FALL SEMESTER</h3>
		<b><u>FRESHMAN SCHOLARSHIPS:</u></b>
		<p style="font-size: 17px;">These awards are not-stackable. Students will receive the highest award for which they qualify within the awarding timeline. All Green & Gold awards are credited in the form of a partial out-of-state tuition waiver; exact award amounts vary based on the number of credits in which a student enrolls each term.</p>
		<p style="font-size: 17px;">Of course, passports are not going away. You will continue to need one to travel. This is why youâ€™re better having more than one.</p>
