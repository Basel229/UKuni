		<p style="font-size: 17px;">Once you’ve completed your course, you have some decisions to make, whether you stay in Australia or return home. You might decide to keep on studying or find a job in Australia or overseas. Whatever you decide, we care about your future and can support you in making the right decision. You can also stay in contact with your friends and peers through alumni networks – useful for ongoing support and employment opportunities.</p>

		<br>
		<p style="font-size: 30px; text-align: left;color: #1f0949;">Finding a job</p>
		<p style="font-size: 17px;">The majority of international graduates say their studies in Australia were a real advantage for their careers. So you can feel confident your education will prepare you for future success.
		However, we believe your study isn’t just about getting a qualification. It’s also about acquiring skills, knowledge, contacts and experience to achieve success in the next phase of your life.

		<p style="font-size: 30px; text-align: left;color: #1f0949;">If you decide to stay in Australia</p>
		<p style="font-size: 17px;">You may be eligible to undertake post-study work to put your newly gained knowledge to use and gain local work experience. Education providers and government bodies help connect students with potential employers at career fairs, employment hubs, job boards and industry networking events in every state and territory. The support, advice and opportunities you access can be a real advantage as you launch your career.</p>

		<br>
		<p style="font-size: 30px; text-align: left;color: #1f0949;">If you decide to find a job overseas</p>
		<p style="font-size: 17px;">Your Australian qualification will make you an attractive employee to employers at home and around the world. In most fields, an Australian qualification is recognised and accepted by employers worldwide. Australian universities and colleges have global networks and can help you make connections with employers overseas.</p>
		
		<br>
		<p style="font-size: 30px; text-align: left;color: #1f0949;">Continue studying in Australia</p>
		<p style="font-size: 17px;">You might be able to keep studying in Australia to gain a higher qualification or embark on another field of study. If you decide to undertake further study, check whether your visa allows this or if you need to apply for a new visa. If you completed a Bachelors, Masters, or Doctoral degree, you could be eligible for the Post-Study Work stream of the Temporary Graduate visa.</p>
		
		<br>
		<p style="font-size: 30px; text-align: left;color: #1f0949;">Preparing to return home</p>
		<p style="font-size: 17px;">Once you’ve finished your degree, you might be eager to head home to see your friends and family. If you go home to do further study or work, there are some essential things to do before you leave Australia:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Work out how to ship your belongings home.</li>
			<li>Get any exam results which are not part of your academic qualification from your institution.</li>
			<li>Claim the security bond from your rental accommodation.</li>
			<li>Join alumni organizations.</li>
			
		</ul>
		<p style="font-size: 17px;">Many institutions run information sessions or seminars with advice on returning home and adjusting to life outside of Australia. Ask your international student support staff for more information.</p>
		<p style="font-size: 17px;">The Official Language Act makes English and French the official languages of Canada and provides for special measures aimed at enhancing the vitality and supporting the development of English and French linguistic minority communities. Canada’s federal institutions reflect the equality of its two official languages by offering bilingual services.</p>

		<p style="font-size: 30px; text-align: left;color: #1f0949;">Staying in touch through alumni groups</p>
		
		<br>
		<p style="font-size: 17px;">With more than half a million international students from 192 countries studying in Australia, we’re sure you’ll have made some new friends from around the world. There’s no better way to stay in touch than through alumni associations.</p>

		<p style="font-size: 17px;">Wherever your post-graduation path leads, joining an alumni group from your institution can help you down the track. You can find and join alumni associations in Australia and back home based on your particular institution, the course you studied, or other students from your country. Most groups and clubs are online, so it is easy to be an active member.</p>

		<p style="font-size: 17px;">Joining an alumni group can help you:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Kickstart your career: Fellow alumni who work in your field can be a great resource when you are establishing your career. They can provide guidance on your industry and information about potential jobs through alumni newsletters and publications.</li>
			<li>Keep in contact: Regular social events allow you to stay in touch even as you and your former classmates join the workforce or pursue study around the world.</li>
			<li>Get the support you need: Family and friends will welcome you at home, but an alumni network is full of people who have shared similar experiences and can support you.</li>
			<li>Give back: Alumni groups enable you to mentor former and current students. You can use your experience and contacts to help other students navigate life and study. Alumni groups organize many charity and community activities, so being a member makes it easy to take part.</li>
			
		</ul>
