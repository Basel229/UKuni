		<p style="font-size: 17px;">Why study in the UK? The UK and its universities have an undisputed reputation for academic excellence and quality with thousands of courses available for students, as well as being an ideal destination for many decades for over a million international students from all over the world.</p>
		<p>There are a variety of reasons why you should consider studying in the UK. Some of these reasons might be exclusively academic for you, but in addition to the high-quality education, you will gain a lot of value from this one-of-a-kind experience, if you choose to study in the UK.</p>
		<p>Furthermore, in comparison to the level of education offered to you, British universities are more affordable. There’s much more you need to know if you’re asking yourself why should I study in the UK. Let’s take a look.</p>

		<br>
		<p style="font-size: 40px; text-align: left;color: #1f0949;">Academic Benefits</p>
		<p style="font-size: 25px; text-align: left;color: #1f0949;">Your Education Will Be Recognized Wherever You Go</p>
		<p style="font-size: 17px;">The academic benefits are probably the main reason why studying in the UK could be the best decision you can take in your life. If you decide to get your education in the UK, your degree will be recognized and respected, no matter where you end up being employed. The education will provide you with a solid foundation and boost your potential for having a higher salary and finding exactly the job you want.</p>
		<p>Every British university is recognized worldwide for having creative and challenging environments that help their students push themselves to the extreme. Their standards are incredibly high, and year after year, the universities are tested for how well they are meeting modern challenges.</p>
		<p>The higher education system in the UK has been the basis for higher education standards in other countries for years.</p>

		<p style="font-size: 25px; text-align: left;color: #1f0949;">Whatever You Decide To Study, You Can Study in the UK</p>
		<p style="font-size: 17px;">The UK has countless high education institutions, and almost every single one of them has opportunities for international students to study there. You can choose from a variety of different undergraduate and graduate degrees, and combine your courses in order to make a degree program that suits your needs and interests.</p>

You can choose from a variety of different undergraduate and graduate degrees, and combine your courses in order to make a degree program that suits your needs and interests.</p>
		<p>There are many universities people have heard of even without any prior research on why studying in the UK is a magnificent opportunity. Oxford and Cambridge are names that are known throughout the world because of their high-quality courses and devotion to education quality and performance. But the UK has a limitless number of universities where you can reach the same exact top quality education. You can find literally any course you want in the UK, and you will find at least one (likely more) schools that will help you excel in your area of expertise.</p>

		<p style="font-size: 25px; text-align: left;color: #1f0949;">You’ll Get The Skills You Need to Succeed</p>
		<p style="font-size: 17px;">In today’s world economy, you need specific skills and qualities to be able to succeed in your field. Employers want high-quality employees who have specific skill sets, including effective, critical, and creative thinking skills. They also want people with a grasp on English – what better way for you to learn English than to learn it in the country of its origin? You can immerse yourself in and learn to live, work, and think in the English language.</p>
		<p style="font-size: 17px;">The learning experience that you will receive when you study in the UK is one that will provide you with the skills you need. You’ll be encouraged to read, think independently, question and analyze what you read and learn. Did you know that British scientists and institutions have won almost 100 Nobel Prizes? Very few countries can claim that level of achievement. People who study art, fashion, film, TV and video game design are considered among the best in the world.</p>

		<p style="font-size: 25px; text-align: left;color: #1f0949;">Why studying in the UK is a perfect option for international students</p>
		<p style="font-size: 17px;">The UK is one of the most popular countries to travel to for the purpose of earning an education. Generations of international students have come to the UK for their education, which means that British universities have decades of experience in working with international students. In other words, you’ll get the red carpet treatment from the time you start applying until you walk across the stage for your degree.</p>
		<p style="font-size: 17px;">There are two major organizations that can help you find out what you need to do in order to study in the UK as an international student. The British Council can work with you on every aspect of applying to university, find which university fits your needs, and get ready to come to study in the UK. The Universities and Colleges Admissions Service can also help you to apply to institutions across the UK as well.</p>

		<p>After you’ve been accepted, your university will treat you well. Many institutions help you get from the airport to your living accommodation, and some even guarantee living accommodations for the first year you are there. Every university has an international student society that will help you become adjusted to life in the UK and connect you with other international students.</p>

		<p style="font-size: 17px;">One important thing to also mention is that many UK universities are also LGBT friendly, and you will never feel marginalized if you belong to this community.</p>
		
		<br>

		<p style="font-size: 40px; text-align: left;color: #1f0949;">Work opportunities</p>
		<p style="font-size: 17px;">Currently, the competition in the job market is tougher than ever before. To be able to survive you must be equipped with top-level skills. What’s the best way of achieving this, except attending a top quality education?  And what’s better than being able to cover all higher tuitions and other living expenses these places carry along entirely on your own? Knowing the financial struggles foreign students usually face abroad, this is why studying in the UK should be your top option.</p>

		<p>If you want to seek an excellent higher education at the smallest price or dream of free education, you’re actually far from reality. In modern times, one without the other is pretty impossible. Indeed, the UK is a particular example of this.</p>
		<p>No matter which university you choose to study in the UK it will cost you quite a lot. But there’s no need to worry. The good news is that, by contrast to the most popular study destinations, in the UK you’re allowed to work while studying. During the regular academic year, you’re permitted to work part-time up to 20 hours per week.</p>
		<p>When the academic year is over you can seek a full-time job. Apparently, you’ll be able to cover all tuition fees and living expenses entirely on our own. At the same time, working during your studies will give you a real independence feeling so you will learn to lean on your own self. Even better, if you show a higher level of commitment and results during your studies you can receive many offers from employers and eventually remain in the UK after university is over. However, there are certain conditions you need to fulfill to achieve this opportunity.</p>
		<p>Firstly, you must have an offer from an employer. A British degree can extra boost your employability and help you to get a visa for staying after you finish university. Second, your eligibility for such visa may be conditioned by a certain minimum salary. Years after you can switch your visa to become a permanent British citizen. Again a certain minimum limit of your salary may be required, for example, £35,000 per year. You wouldn’t be the first and the last one to have this destiny because many have had this luck. Knowing this will help you remove any doubt you may have to study in the UK.</p>

		<br>

		<p style="font-size: 40px; text-align: left;color: #1f0949;">Financial Benefits</p>
		<p style="font-size: 25px;">British Universities are Affordable, No Matter Which You Choose</p>
		<p style="font-size: 17px;">UK degrees take less time to attain than degrees in other countries. Where other countries take at least four years for an undergraduate degree and two or three years for a postgraduate degree; in the UK only takes three years for an undergraduate degree, and one year for a postgraduate (unless you are in research, then it may take 18 months to 2 years). That means that you are spending less money overall.</p>
		<p>On top of that, there is a lot of “free money” (scholarships, grants, and bursaries) available from British universities or certain institutions that are just for international students. Over 20,000 international students also get other financial aid from the UK government, and you can work while you’re studying in the UK as well.</p>

		<br>

		<p style="font-size: 40px; text-align: left;color: #1f0949;">Financial Benefits</p>
		<p style="font-size: 17px;">If you were asked about your top reasons for living and studying in the UK, you would probably mention the cost of living. We discuss the cost of living in another article, but as you will be able to see, it’s fairly reasonable to live in England. Obviously, it will cost a bit more if you live in a city like London, but in general, costs are reasonable. You’ll want to do research before you come, though, in order to learn more about the cost of living in your particular area.</p>
		<p>The cost of living also includes health care, and in the UK, that’s not much of a worry at all. The UK is one of the countries which has an institutionalized, national health care system, which will reduce your overall health care costs. In another one of our articles, we explore the National Health Service (NHS) and how that can help you stay healthy during the time you study in the UK.</p>

		<br>

		<p style="font-size: 40px; text-align: left;color: #1f0949;">Other Benefits</p>
		<p style="font-size: 25px;">The UK Has a Unique Culture</p>
		<p style="font-size: 17px;">The UK is quite a unique country. Thousands of families from around the world have decided to live in the UK, which gives it a rich, multicultural atmosphere that you cannot find anywhere else in the world.</p>
		<p>Every year, over 200,000 international students decide to study only in England, while the number of them choosing to study in the UK is even bigger. In the UK you’ll encounter a diverse community. You’ll get to mix and meet people throughout the world, and your experience will be even richer because of being able to interact with so many different types of people. You’ll get insights into other countries and cultures, and learn a lot more than you may have been able to in your home country.</p>
		<p>The UK isn’t just unique because of its cosmopolitan flair, though. The UK holds a rich, interesting history that makes it an ideal place for people of all backgrounds. Commerce is also immense in cities like London. The nightlife is varied all over the country, and there is always something to do. Art galleries, concerts, open-air markets, and pubs are popular places for the English to congregate and enjoy themselves.</p>
		<p>If you decide to study in UK, you will never be bored, there is always something new to do, and there are always new people to meet.</p>

		<p style="font-size: 25px;">The UK is the Gateway to The Rest of Europe</p>
		<p style="font-size: 17px;">If you want to travel Europe, the UK is the place to be. In the United Kingdom alone, you can travel to Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland and learn about the different backgrounds and lifestyles in each country. Public transportation makes it simple to travel the entire United Kingdom and take in the sights and sounds. As a student, you can receive special rates for transportation when you buy monthly passes.</p>
		<p>Those same public transportation routes can be utilized to reach the rest of Europe. The Chunnel (English Channel Tunnel) can take you right into mainland Europe within a day. You can obtain public transportation passes for the countries close to the UK, and you can explore wherever you want on the continent. Just make sure you have the necessary paperwork to do so (passports), and take the time you’ll have on weekends and long breaks in order to take in the sights and sounds of the rest of mainland Europe.</p>
		<p>A world-class education in a multicultural world can help to make you ready for the life that you will have after university. And it really helps that you will be able to enjoy UK and Europe in a unique way that you couldn’t anywhere else. Now that you’ve taken a look, why won’t you consider to study in the UK in your near future?

		<p style="font-size: 25px;">The UK student visa</p>
		<p style="font-size: 17px;">In order to be able to stay in the UK as an international student, you must have a student visa.  To some extent getting a student visa in the UK is easier than in different countries. This guide will learn steps and documents you’ll need to take a student visa in the UK. For a much detailed description  you can find information here https://www.studying-in-uk.org/visa-and-entry-requirements/</p>
		<p>Student visa in the UK is called Tier4 visa. There are two types of  Tier4 visas:</p>
		<p>Tier4 (General) –   For students</p>
		<p>Tier4 (Child) – children aged 4 to 17</p>
		<p>Universities that want to receive foreign students have to seek the status of Tier4 sponsor at the Home Office of the Immigration regulator.</p>
		<p>If you’re 16 or older than that you can apply for a Tier4 (General) visa to study in the UK. Here are the basic eligibility requirements so you can apply for such visa</p>
		<ul>
			<li>If you have been admitted into a course in the UK</li>
			<li>You have a proof of your English proficiency</li>
			<li>You have enough money to cover all tuition and living expenses in the UK</li>
			<li>You are from a country rather than one in the list below (including Switzerland)</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Austria</li>
				<li>Belgium</li>
				<li>Bulgaria</li>
				<li>Croatia</li>
				<li>Republic of Cyprus</li>
				<li>Czech Republic</li>
				<li>Denmark</li>
				<li>Estonia</li>
				<li>Finland</li>
				<li>France</li>
				<li>Germany</li>
				<li>Greece</li>
				<li>Hungary</li>
				<li>Iceland</li>
				<li>Ireland</li>
				<li>Italy</li>
				<li>Latvia</li>
				<li>Liechtenstein</li>
				<li>Lithuania</li>
				<li>Luxembourg</li>
				<li>Malta</li>
				<li>Netherlands</li>
				<li>Norway</li>
				<li>Poland</li>
				<li>Portugal</li>
				<li>Romania</li>
				<li>Slovakia</li>
				<li>Slovenia</li>
				<li>Spain</li>
				<li>Sweden</li>

			</ul>
		</ul>

		<p>The application process for a student visa carries a higher fee if you apply from outside the UK (£335 per an applicant). Make sure to apply 3 months before your study courses start. Note that it may happen that the Immigration regulator may arrange an interview with you to know if you’re a genuine student, although your application up to that step has been alright.</p>
