		<p style="font-size: 17px;">Before World War I, you didn’t need a passport for international travel.</p>
		<p style="font-size: 17px;">People simply went wherever they wanted. In many cases, they didn’t need any kind of permission from a government agency.</p>
		<p style="font-size: 17px;">Obviously, that’s not how it works today.</p>
		<p style="font-size: 17px;">Today, governments use passports to document and control their citizens. In my view, the world would be better off without them.</p>
		<p style="font-size: 17px;">Of course, passports are not going away. You will continue to need one to travel. This is why you’re better having more than one.</p>
		<p style="font-size: 17px;">A second passport keeps the government from locking you in. Without it, the government in your home country can effectively place you under house arrest by taking back your passport.</p>
		<p style="font-size: 17px;">Among other things, having a second passport allows you to invest, bank, travel, live, and do business in places you wouldn’t otherwise be able to.</p>
		<p style="font-size: 17px;">Obtaining a second passport is a fundamental step toward freeing yourself from absolute dependence on any one country. Once you have that freedom, it’s much harder for any government to control your destiny.</p>
		<p style="font-size: 17px;">No matter where you live, you can benefit from the political diversification that comes with a second passport.</p>

		<br>
		<p style="font-size: 30px; text-align: left;color: #1f0949;">Benefits and Privileges </p>
		<p style="font-size: 17px;">Dual citizens can receive the benefits and privileges offered by each country. For example, they have access to two social service systems, can vote in either country or may be able to run for office in either country, depending on the law. They are also allowed to work in either country without needing a work permit or visa and can attend school in either country at the citizen tuition rate.
		</p>


		<p style="font-size: 30px; text-align: left;color: #1f0949;">Two Passports </p>
		<p style="font-size: 17px;">As a dual citizen, you are allowed to carry passports from both countries. For example, if you are a U.S. citizen and also a citizen of New Zealand, you can travel more easily between the two countries. Having a citizen's passport eliminates the need for long-stay visas and questioning about the purpose of your trip. It also guarantees the right of entry to both countries, which can be especially important if you have a family to visit, are a student or do business in either country.</p>

		<br>
		<p style="font-size: 30px; text-align: left;color: #1f0949;">Property Ownership </p>
		<p style="font-size: 17px;">Another benefit of dual citizenship is the ability to own property in either country. Some countries restrict land ownership to citizens only. As a legal citizen of two countries, you would be able to purchase property in either – or both – countries. If you travel frequently between the two countries, this might be especially useful since property ownership might offer a more economical way to live in two places.</p>
		
		<br>
		<p style="font-size: 30px; text-align: left;color: #1f0949;">Cultural Education</p>
		<p style="font-size: 17px;">As a dual citizen, you'll reap the benefits of being immersed in the culture of the two countries. Some government officials are also fond of dual citizenship and see it to promote the country's image as a prime destination for tourists. Perhaps the best upside is the satisfaction of learning about the history of both countries, a new language and a different way of life.</p>
		
		<br>
		<p style="font-size: 30px; text-align: left;color: #1f0949;">More Visa Free for Travel</p>
		<p style="font-size: 17px;">Applying for a visa before a trip is a real hassle. It can be frustrating, time-consuming, and expensive. A good second passport gives you visa-free access to more countries than you had before. Take St. Kitts & Nevis, for example. It’s one of the easiest countries in the world to obtain a second passport from. A passport from St. Kitts & Nevis lets you travel visa-free to 152 countries including Europe and UK.</p>
