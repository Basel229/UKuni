		<p style="font-size: 17px;">The economic impact of immigration is an important topic in Canada. While the immigration rate has dropped sharply from its peak early in the 20th century, Canada is still among the countries in the world that accept most immigrants per capita.</p>
		<p style="font-size: 17px;">The per capita immigration rate to Canada has been relatively constant since the 1950s, and recent years have seen a steady increase in the education and skill level of immigrants to Canada. However, over the last 25 years the economic position of newcomers to Canada relative to the native population has steadily declined. A 2007 Statistics Canada study shows that the income profile of recent immigrant families deteriorated by a significant amount from 2000 to 2004. Recent immigrants themselves are far more likely than native born Canadians to initially have low incomes, with income and employment rates increasing towards the national average with more time spent in Canada.</p>

		<p style="font-size: 17px;">With our rich history of immigration, Canada is a well-known multicultural country, which respects the contributions and individuality of different cultures. Canada never stops seeking skilled and talented newcomers to support the development of the Canadian economy. Canada is home to many immigrants from all over the world.
		</p>

		<p style="font-size: 17px;">Today, Canada still attracts many newcomers because of our:</p>

		<br>
		<ul>
			<li>Natural beauty, wide-open spaces, mountains, trees, and lakes</li>
			<li>Free society with fundamental human rights enshrined in a Charter of Rights and Freedoms</li>
			<li>Political stability with excellent business opportunities and a strong banking system</li>
			<li>Free trade with United-States and Mexico under NAFTA agreements</li>
			<li>Education system with an excellent international reputation of Canadian Universities</li>
			<li>Excellent healthcare system and generous network of social assistance programs</li>
			<li>One of the nicest countries in the world with excellent business opportunities</li>
		</ul>
		
	
		
		<p style="font-size: 17px;">The Canadian government understands the difficulty for newcomers/immigrants to adapt to a new country, to learn new cultures and languages; therefore, the Government of Canada, Provincial Governments, and many public/private community organizations work together to provide assistance in such areas as language training, finding employment, education, finding a place to live and much more.
