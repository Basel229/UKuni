		<p style="font-size: 17px;">Obtaining a second passport is a fundamental step toward freeing yourself from absolute dependence on any one country. Once you have that freedom, it’s much harder for any government to control your destiny. No matter where you live, you can benefit from the political diversification that comes with a second passport.</p>
		<p style="font-size:17px;">Dual citizens can receive the benefits and privileges offered by each country. For example, they have access to two social service systems, can vote in either country or may be able to run for office in either country, depending on the law. They are also allowed to work in either country without needing a work permit or visa and can attend school in either country at the citizen tuition rate.</p>
