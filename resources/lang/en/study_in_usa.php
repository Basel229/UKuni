',
	'subhead4li2' => 'For the first two years of the program most doctoral candidates enroll in classes and seminars.

',
	'subhead4li3' => 'A doctoral dissertation is a discussion and summary of the current scholarship on a given topic. Most U.S. universities awarding doctorates also require their candidates to have a reading knowledge of two foreign languages, to spend a required length of time “in residence,” to pass a qualifying examination that officially admits candidates to the PhD program, and to pass an oral examination on the same topic as the dissertation.
